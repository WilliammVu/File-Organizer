# Smart File Organizer

Working with a terminal can be difficult when there are so many functionalities to remember
This file organizer is a single-file C++ program that is meant to simplify file-related command line shell operations.

Prerequisites:
- C++ compiler with support for C++ version 17

Note: This program runs on MacOS/Linux, so it must be tweaked to support the slight nuances associated with Windows.
