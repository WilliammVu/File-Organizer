# Smart File Organizer

Working with a terminal can be difficult when there are so many functionalities to remember
This file organizer is a single-file C++ program that is meant to simplify command line shell operations.
Essentially a subset of zsh/bash but with assistance that increases ease-of-use

Prerequisites:
- C++ compiler with support for C++ version 17
- This program supports Linux/MacOS/Windows

Future Recommendations:
- add more functionality (e.g. move, echo, cat, etc.)
- Replace main function's else if chain into a switch table
